Hazards
*******

The following are a list of known problems that could cause the machine to crash or otherwise not function correctly.

The A-axis can be crashed into the front control box unless it is put in the t-slot closest to the front of the machine.

When using the A-axis with a tailstock it is possible for tooling to crash into the tailstock when the ATC rotates.

The A-axis must be installed on the right side of the machine to avoid crashes with tooling in the ATC.

Large tools can pull out of collets

tools can be loaded into the collet incorrectly, especially the reference tool, effecting tool length

Probes must be calibrated in the correct order
1. insert ref tool, set sensor height of tool setter
2. set work offset to zero using tool setter
3. insert tool 99, set tool length
4. test
